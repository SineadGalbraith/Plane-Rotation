# Plane-Rotation

The objective of this assignment was to create a simple model of an aeroplane and use the keyboard and mouse input to display the pitch, roll and yaw rotations of the plane.

Extra Features Include: 
- Overcoming gimbal-lock using quaternions to represent the rotations.
- Hierarchical Moving Elements.
- Using a 3D plane model rather than a cylinder.

C/C++ and OpenGL have been used for this assignment.
